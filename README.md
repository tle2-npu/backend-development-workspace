- Developing good documentation and professional coding habits

## How I will use this repository
- Organize my work by unit using clearly structured folders
- Track my progress and reflect on what I learn in the learning log
- Store reference materials and useful links for backend development
- Practice meaningful Git commits and version control workflows
- Showcase my backend development journey in a clean and professional way
